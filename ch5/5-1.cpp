Accelerated C++, Exercise 5-1, 5_1.cpp
Design and implement a program to produce a permuted index. A permuted index
is one in which each phrase is indexed by every word in the phrase. So, given the
following input,

The quick brown 		fox
jumped over the 		fence
the output would 		be
The quick       		brown fox
jumped over the 		fence
The quick brown 		fox
jumped over the 		fence
jumped          		over the fence
The             		quick brown fox
jumped over     		the fence
						The quick brown fox
