### Q1: Suppose we wish to find the median of a collection of values. Assume that we have read some of the values so far, and that we have no idea how many values remain to be read. Prove that we cannot afford to discard any of the values that we have read. *Hint:* One proof strategy is to assume that we can discard a value, and then find values for the unread—and therefore unknown—part of our collection that would cause the median to be the value that we discarded.
Let's say we have read the values 3, 4, and 7. It seems probable that we can discard the smallest or the largest value. Let's discard them. Now we have 4. Now, let's say we now read 1 and 2. Now we have 1, 2, and 4. It seems that the median should be 2, however, if we have not discarded any values, we would have 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7. The median would be 3, which we have discarded. That proves that we cannot afford to discard any value we have already read.
